 # :bookmark:CodeBlockPrism extension for TIPTAP Editor
 This extension is based on [CodeBlockLowlight](https://tiptap.dev/api/nodes/code-block-lowlight). Most of the code in this repository is taken from there.
 
 ## :cat: What for? Why not CodeBlockLowlight?
 
 Unfortunately CodeBlockLowlight is based on [LowLight](https://github.com/wooorm/lowlight) and [Highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/), 
 Highlight.js supports many languages ​​but doesn't support many useful syntax. For example: **JSX, TSX, MDX.**
 
 The list of supported Prism.js languages ​​can be found here:  https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages
 ## ✍️ How to use it?
 ```js
const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
        Document,
        Paragraph,
        Text,
        CodeBlock,
        CodeBlockPrism.configure({
            defaultLanguage: 'jsx',
        }),
    ],
    content: ``,
});
 ```
  ## :hammer_and_wrench: How to style classes generated by PrismJS?
  You can define styles via CSS. There are already ready-made themes, for example: [OneDark](https://github.com/AGMStudio/prism-theme-one-dark/blob/master/prism-onedark.css)
